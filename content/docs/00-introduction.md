ReactSCC is a <span class="primary">S</span>tate, <span class="primary">C</span>ontroller, and <span class="primary">C</span>omponent building pattern.
It modularized the component by extracting logic and state out of the component.
ReactSCC aims to improve the developer experience for building complex UIs using React Js.
It provides a reactive state and a controller for the functional component.
The functional component is a dumb component that does not have its internal state and only consumes props to render the UI. Which ultimately makes testable UI.
